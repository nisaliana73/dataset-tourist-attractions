3,Japan,Asia,"Mount Fuji is with 3776 meters Japan's highest mountain.

Mount Fuji is an active volcano, which most recently erupted in 1707. It stands on the border between Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on clear days. Note however, that clouds and poor visibility often block the view of Mount Fuji, and you have to consider yourself lucky if you get a clear view of the mountain. Visibility tends to be better during the colder seasons of the year than in summer, and in the early morning and late evening hours than during the middle of the day. Although clouds frequently obscure the peak, you should be able to see it in the morning. The following locations offer some of the best views of Mount Fuji: Koyo-Dai, Chureito Pagoda, Route 134, Mt. Fuji Panorama Ropeway, and Izunokuni Panorama Park. If you want to enjoy Mount Fuji at a more leisurely pace and from a nice natural surrounding, you should head to the Fuji Five Lake (Fujigoko) region at the northern foot of the mountain, or to Hakone, a nearby hot spring resort.

4,China,Asia,"The Great Wall of China is one of the most notorious structures in the entire world. Great Wall of China one of the largest building-construction projects ever undertaken. The Great Wall actually consists of numerous walls—many of them parallel to each other—built over some two millennia across northern China and southern Mongolia.

This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and mountains as it snakes across the Chinese countryside, and about one-fourth of its length consists solely of natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges.

Although lengthy sections of the wall are now in ruins or have disappeared completely, it is still one of the more remarkable structures on Earth.
